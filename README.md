Build a Personal AI Time Management Assistant

### **Main Idea**
The chatbot will act as a **Personal AI Time Management Assistant**. It will help users plan and track their time effectively by integrating scheduling, motivation, reminders, and productivity insights. The bot will utilize the **Telethon library** for Telegram API interactions and may incorporate AI features for personalized time management.

### **Core Functionality**
1. **Task and Schedule Management**:
   - Add, update, and delete tasks.
   - Set reminders and deadlines.
   - Display a daily/weekly schedule.
    (with schedule)

2. **Motivation and Productivity Tracking**:
   - Send motivational quotes or messages based on user preferences.
   - Track completed tasks and visualize progress.

3. **Smart Recommendations**:
   - Provide suggestions to optimize schedules.
   - Identify unproductive patterns and suggest improvements.

4. **Natural Interaction**:
   - Respond to natural language commands like "Remind me to study at 5 PM" or "What's my schedule tomorrow?"
   - Use AI to prioritize tasks based on importance or deadlines.

5. **Customization**:
   - Allow users to personalize reminders, themes, or messages.

6. **Gadget Usage Tracking**:
   - Optional feature to log and analyze time spent on Telegram/gadgets.

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Create the Bot**

#### **1. Setup**
   1. Install Python and dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install telethon
      ```
   2. Obtain API keys for Telegram:
      - Register at [Telegram BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
      - Get the API ID and Hash for your app from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).

#### **2. Initialize the Telethon Client**
   Create a Python script for the bot:
   ```python
   from telethon import TelegramClient

   api_id = 'YOUR_API_ID'
   api_hash = 'YOUR_API_HASH'
   bot_token = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'

   client = TelegramClient('bot', api_id, api_hash).start(bot_token=bot_token)
   ```

#### **3. Create Command Handlers**
   Implement basic command handlers, e.g., `/start` to greet the user:
   ```python
   @client.on(events.NewMessage(pattern='/start'))
   async def start(event):
       await event.reply("Hi! I'm your Personal AI Time Management Assistant. How can I help you today?")
   ```

#### **4. Implement Core Features**
   - **Task Management**:
     Create functions to handle adding, listing, and removing tasks. Use a local database (SQLite or JSON) to store user data.

   - **Reminders**:
     Use a scheduler like `apscheduler` to handle reminders.
     ```bash
     pip install apscheduler
     ```

   Example:
   ```python
   from apscheduler.schedulers.asyncio import AsyncIOScheduler

   scheduler = AsyncIOScheduler()
   scheduler.start()

   def schedule_reminder(chat_id, text, time):
       scheduler.add_job(
           send_reminder,
           'date',
           run_date=time,
           args=[chat_id, text]
       )

   async def send_reminder(chat_id, text):
       await client.send_message(chat_id, text)
   ```

   - **Daily Schedule Display**:
     Provide a formatted overview of the user's day:
     ```python
     @client.on(events.NewMessage(pattern='/schedule'))
     async def schedule(event):
         tasks = get_user_tasks(event.chat_id)  # Fetch tasks from the database
         reply = "\n".join([f"{task['time']}: {task['name']}" for task in tasks])
         await event.reply(reply or "You have no tasks scheduled.")
     ```

#### **5. Add AI Features**
   - **Natural Language Processing**:
     Integrate an AI model (like OpenAI's GPT or similar) to parse and respond to commands.
   - **Prioritization**:
     Develop an algorithm to recommend task priorities based on urgency or importance.

#### **6. Test and Debug**
   - Test the bot locally with different scenarios.
   - Handle edge cases like overlapping tasks, invalid inputs, etc.

#### **7. Deploy**
   - Use a server or cloud platform like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **PythonAnywhere** to host the bot.
   - Run the bot as a persistent service.
